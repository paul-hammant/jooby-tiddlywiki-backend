== Building

Run `./update-html.sh` to download index.html file into `public/` which itself is not checked in. This gets the main
JavaScript app from another repo.


Otherwise:

```
./gradlew build
```

== Running tests

Tests are unit tests, followed by service tests using RestAssured, followed by functional/integration UI tests using
WebDriver.

Run all tests:
```
./gradlew check
```

Run unit tests:
```
./gradlew test
```

Run service (RestAssured, no UI) tests:
```
./gradlew serviceTest
```

Run functional (Selenium of UI including JavaScript implicitly) tests:
```
./gradlew functionalTest
```

== Launching locally

```
./gradlew run
```

Then open your browser on `http://localhost:8080/` and click around
