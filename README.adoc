== Building

Run `./update-html.sh` to download index.html file into `public/` which itself is not checked in. This gets the main
JavaScript app from another repo.


Otherwise:

```
gradle build
```

== Running tests

```
gradle test
```

Tests are unit tests, followed by service tests using RestAssured, followed by functional UI tests using WebDriver.

== Launching locally

```
gradle run
```

Then open your browser on `http://localhost:8080/` and click around
